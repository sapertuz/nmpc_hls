# NMPC Controller with PSO Hardware Acceleration

This repository implements a hardware-accelerated Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The project includes both high-level MATLAB simulation code and synthesizable C++ code for Vivado HLS targeting FPGA deployment. It supports multiple systems such as the **Inverted Pendulum** and the **Sniffbot quadrotor**.
